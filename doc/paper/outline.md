**Identification of tumor modulating bacterial populations in the gut microbiome**
*   Segregate into high, medium, and low categories and run lefse (5)
*   Comment on patchiness of communities - indicator bugs are not found in all
    mice that have tumors (6)


**Microbiome dynamics reveal potential associations between bacterial populations that mediate tumorigenesis**
*   Change not associated with tumor burden (7)
*   Pick treatments with biggest change in community structure and describe
    changes in bacterial communities for those treatments over time (8)


**Antibiotic intervention narrows possible mechanisms of microbiome involvement in tumorigenesis **
*   Intervention experiment (9)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*   Antibiotic perturbations create different community structures
    -   Model
    -   Phylum-level descriptions / diversity
    -   No effect on bacterial load
*   Predict tumor levels based on day 0 community composition
    -   Very different starting communities goes to similar and different numbers
        of tumors
    -   Tumor count strip chart
    -   Feature plot
*   Temporal dynamics of communities with biggest differences in tumor counts
*   Intervention experiment
